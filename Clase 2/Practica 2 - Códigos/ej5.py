based Modeling Toolkit with Python Version 3
resumen: Distributed agent-based modeling (ABM) on high-performance 
computing resources provides the promise of capturing unprecedented 
details of large-scale complex systems. However, the specialized 
knowledge required for developing such ABMs creates barriers to wider 
adoption and utilization. Here we present our experiences in 
developing an initial implementation of Repast4Py, a Python-based 
distributed ABM toolkit. We build on our experiences in developing ABM
toolkits, including Repast for High Performance Computing (Repast 
HPC), to identify the key elements of a useful distributed ABM 
toolkit. We leverage the Numba, NumPy, and PyTorch packages and the

largest HPC resources and emerging computing architectures. """
